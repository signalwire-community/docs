# Relay.Task

A `Relay.Task` is simple way to send jobs to your [`Relay.Consumers`](php/reference/relay_consumer.mdx) from a short lived process, like a web framework. Relay Tasks allow you to pass commands down to your Consumers without blocking your short lived request. Think of a Relay Task as a way to queue a job for your background workers to processes asynchronously.

## Creating Tasks

A Task is a simple object with 2 required arguments: `$project` and `$token`. Project and Token are used to send the Task to your Consumers. Once created, the Task has only one method `deliver` to send jobs to your Consumer.

```php
<?php

require dirname(__FILE__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use SignalWire\Relay\Tasking\Task;

$task = new Task('XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX', 'PTXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');
$context = 'office';
$delivered = $task->deliver($context, [
  'key' => 'value',
  'data' => 'data for your job'
]);
```

## Methods

<div class="method-definitions"></div>

#### deliver

Send a job to your `Consumer` in a specific context.

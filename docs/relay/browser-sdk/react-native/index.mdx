# React Native Library for SignalWire

SignalWire Community's React Library enables the seamless integration of
SignalWire APIs with React applications. With the use of high quality components
and hooks, you can get started in minutes.

 - **npm:** [@signalwire-community/react-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@signalwire-community/react-native) ![@signalwire-community/react-native](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@signalwire-community/react-native)
 - **GitHub:** [signalwire-community/react](https://github.com/signalwire-community/react)

## Installation

We suggest to use this library in the context of an Expo dev build, which you can initialize as follows:

```bash
npx create-react-native-app -t with-webrtc
```

This will set up a custom Expo development build from a template that is preconfigured for using WebRTC.

After that, you can install the React Native Library for SignalWire:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @signalwire-community/react-native react-native-get-random-values
```

## Hooks

You can use [most of the hooks](relay/browser-sdk/react/hooks.mdx) from _@signalwire-community/react_ into your React Native application.

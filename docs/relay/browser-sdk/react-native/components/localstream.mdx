# LocalStream

This React component gives you an easy way to display the local stream
transmitted in a room session.

Please note that this will not include local overlays, so you may notice a
slight latency in your own camera stream.

## Example

```jsx
<LocalStream roomSession={roomSession} style={{ height: 150 }} />
```

# FaxResponse

The `FaxResponse` class is used to create a fax XML string using the Java Wrapper Library.

## Usage

```java

// Create an HashMap to store attribute needed to use a verb
HashMap<String, String> faxAttribute = new HashMap<>();

faxAttribute.put("action", "/fax/received");

// Generate the XML
FaxResponse response = new FaxResponse.Builder()
            .receive(faxAttribute)
            .build();

// Print out the XML
System.out.println(response.getResponse());

```

The above snippet prints out

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<Response>
    <Receive action="/fax/received"/>
</Response>
```

While most of the `useSignalWire` hook works exactly the same as the [React version](/docs/react/signalwire), there are a few additions
to handle React Native specific tasks.

# Added SignalWire client methods

### The `.registerDevice` method

This method registers an iOS or Android device to be able to receive push notifications from SignalWire.
In particular, this method sends the device's device token to SignalWire, without which push notifications can't
be sent from the server.

For iOS, it needs to be specifically be the VoIP notification token.

```js
const client = useSignalWire({ token: ACCESS_TOKEN });
// ...
// Retrieve DEVICE_TOKEN from the device after getting permissions to send
// push notifications.
// DEVICE_TOKEN is not the same as ACCESS_TOKEN, which you'd get from SignalWire.
client.registerDevice({ deviceToken: DEVICE_TOKEN });
```

### The `.unregisterDevice` method

Call this method to unregister the device from receiving push notifications (such as, when logging out from the phone).

```js
function logout() {
  client.unregisterDevice();
}
```

### The `.handlePushNotification` method

Call this method when a push notification payload is received for a Fabric call. It will
set up the call and return a call handle object.

This library doesn't help you receive the notification payloads or device tokens. Please use
[`react-native-callkeep`](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep) or [`react-native-voip-push-notifications`](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-voip-push-notification) or similar libraries for that
purpose.

```js
function onNotificationPayloadReceived(){
    try {
        const callHandle = await client.handlePushNotification(payload);
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Unable to process payload");
    }
}
```

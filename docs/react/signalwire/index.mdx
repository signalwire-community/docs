# Introduction [Alpha]

The SignalWire client allows you to make calls to Fabric subscribers and addresses. It is supported in the React ecosystem
using a few components and hooks.

:::warning

Please note that the Call Fabric is still in Alpha. The interfaces might have changed and
the docs might not have caught up.

Feel free to contact SignalWire support if something doesn't work.

:::

## The [useSignalWire](./useSignalWire) hook

The `useSignalWire` hook will return a SignalWire client given a valid token. You will generally
feed this client into any other component or hook that works on Fabric resources.

## The [useAddresses](./useAddresses) hook

The `useAddresses` hook will take a SignalWire client and return a list of Fabric addresses that can be called into. The list
is automatically updated in case new entries are added.

## The [Call](./Call) component

This component will place a call to a given Fabric address. It expects you to provide a SignalWire client to place the call with.

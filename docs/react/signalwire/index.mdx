# Introduction

The SignalWire client allows you to make calls to Fabric subscribers and addresses. It is supported in the React ecosystem
using a few components and hooks.

## The [useSignalWire](./useSignalWire) hook

The `useSignalWire` hook will return a SignalWire client given a valid token. You will generally
feed this client into any other component or hook that works on Fabric resources.

## The [useAddresses](./useAddresses) hook

The `useAddresses` hook will take a SignalWire client and return a list of Fabric addresses that can be called into. The list
is automatically updated in case new entries are added.

## The [Call](./Call) component

This component will place a call to a given Fabric address. It expects you to provide a SignalWire client to place the call with.

# useSignalWire [Alpha]

This hook instantiates a SignalWire client given an access token. The client can make calls to
Fabric addresses. Pass the client to other hooks and components to make use of it.

:::warning

Please note that the Call Fabric is still in Alpha. The interfaces might have changed and
the docs might not have caught up.

Feel free to contact SignalWire support if something doesn't work.

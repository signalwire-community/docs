# VoiceResponse

The `VoiceResponse` class is used to create a voice XML using the Java Wrapper Library.

## Usage

```java
// Create an HashMap to store attribute needed to use a verb
HashMap<String, String> voiceAttribute = new HashMap<>();

voiceAttribute.put("callerId", "testing");

// Generate the XML
VoiceResponse response = new VoiceResponse.Builder()
        .say(null, "Welcome to SignalWire Java Comp!")
        .dial(voiceAttribute, "+1234567811")
        .build();

// Print out the XML
System.out.println(response.getResponse());
```

The above snippet prints out:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<Response>
    <Say>Welcome to SignalWire Java Comp!</Say>
    <Dial callerId="testing">+1234567811</Dial>

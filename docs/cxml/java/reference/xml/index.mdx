# XML Bins

XML bins, sometimes referred to as LaML bins, create a URL endpoint that responds with a set of instructions that can be executed to handle calls, SMS, or fax.

## Usage

The following example shows how to make use of the [LamlRepository](cxml/java/reference/xml/LamlRepository.mdx) to get all the Bins on your SignalWire space.

```java
String projectId = "xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx";
String apiToken = "PTXXXXXXXXX";
SignalWireClient client = new SignalWireClient(projectId, apiToken, "space-name");

// Get a reference the XML repository object
LamlRepository repository = client.xml();

// Get list of Bin on your SignalWire space
LamlResponse response = repository.list();
```
